# Slide 3: Data Acquisition Process

**Data Capture:**  
Landsat 8 collects data using sensors that capture both reflected sunlight and emitted thermal energy.  
It revisits the same location every 16 days to monitor changes over time.

---

# Slide 4: Spatial Resolution

**Resolution Details:**  
- Panchromatic band: 15 meters  
- Multispectral bands: 30 meters  
- Thermal bands: 100 meters (resampled to 30 meters)

---

# Slide 5: Temporal Resolution

**Revisit Cycle:**  
The satellite has a 16-day revisit cycle, ensuring consistent monitoring of land changes and environmental conditions.

---

# Slide 6: Applications in Remote Sensing

**Common Applications:**  
- Agricultural monitoring  
- Forest and water resource management  
- Urban development studies  
- Disaster assessment and response

---

# Slide 7: Case Study

**Example Study:**  
A study using Landsat 8 data to assess deforestation trends in a specific region.  
The research demonstrates how temporal analysis helps in tracking land cover changes over years.

---

# Slide 8: Advantages and Limitations

**Advantages:**  
- High-resolution, multispectral data  
- Consistent data collection over time

**Limitations:**  
- Data quality can be affected by cloud cover  
- Lower revisit frequency compared to some modern satellites

---

# Slide 9: Conclusion

**Summary:**  
Landsat 8 provides invaluable data for a wide range of environmental and land management applications.  
While it has some limitations, its historical archive and multispectral capabilities make it a cornerstone in remote sensing.
